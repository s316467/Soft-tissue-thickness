% The use of BibTeX is required.
% 
% To use BibTeX, you must:
% 1. Create a database (.bib) file that describes the articles or books you 
%    want to reference. The NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) provides
%    automatic tools for retrieving a .bib file including entries for a
%    selection of articles. An example of a typical .bib file is given 
%    in file "sample_saj.bib".
%    If there is no entry in ADS for some of your references, you are
%    obliged to add these entries into your .bib file "by hand" respecting
%    the formal structure of the record. Standard journal abbreviations
%    defined by ADS are required.
% 2. Specify the style and location of the bibliography in your 
%    LaTeX document. The SAJ package includes a style file aa_url_saj.bst that
%    will format your reference list in the proper SAJ format.  Before
%    running BibTeX you must ensure that the requested files (i.e.  bib, bst
%    and cls files) are in the same directory as your LaTeX files.
% 3. Run pdflatex, then bibtex, and pdflatex again twice. Remember you must run 
%    pdflatex twice to update the citations.
%
% Some more details about BibTeX from NASA ADS:
%   http://ads.harvard.edu/pubs/bibtex/
%
% Following command together with the style loading commands in the preamble
% will include your .bib file with bibliography entries and after processing
% will produce the "References" list.  Please, follow the rules given bellow
% to compile BibTeX correctly.

% To ensure that each reference is spelled properly, and to facilitate ADS
% crossreferencing as well, every author is also obliged to supply an
% ADS-identification entry of each reference. This ADS-identification entry
% has the form of a LaTeX comment just in front of a given reference on a
% separate line, which has to start with a key-word "ADS_ID". In order to
% find a specific ADS-identification, please use the following on-line form
%    http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-abs_connect
% An ADS-identification entry is a unique string whose length is exactly 19
% characters, e.g. 1955ApJ...121..349B
% The example:
%   ADS_ID 1955ApJ...121..349B
%
% When you use SAJ BibTeX and your .bib file was produced by means of the
% NASA ADS system mentioned above, these "ADS_ID"s will be produced
% automatically. Thus no your intervention is required.
