Final Consideration


Random Forest is the best model for your bmi analysis and it shows that
the top landmarks are:
Rhinion
Orbital Right
Superius Left

Random Forest is the best model for your gender and bmi analysis and it shows that
the top landmarks are:
Superius Left
Nasion
Superius Right
There are not enough information to determine which landmarks are important for your age and bmi analysis.There are not enough information to determine which landmarks are important for your gender,age and bmi analysis.
